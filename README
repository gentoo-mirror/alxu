This is Alex Xu (Hello71)'s personal Gentoo overlay. Ebuilds are of varying
quality and should generally be checked before use. Packages that also exist in
::gentoo generally have minor modifications.

Note in particular that openjdk packages are tested infrequently due to
excessively long compile time.

Please submit problems/questions/etc to alex at alxu under the Canadian ccTLD,
