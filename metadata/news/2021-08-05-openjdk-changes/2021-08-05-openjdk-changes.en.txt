As of jdk8u302, jdk-11.0.12+7, and jdk-16.0.2+7, AdoptOpenJDK builds have
ceased. The replacements are Eclipse Temurin and IBM Semeru builds. Temurin
JREs and non-x86_64 architectures are not yet available upstream, but will be
added as they become available. IBM Semeru has JREs and JDKs available for all
AdoptOpenJDK architectures, so may be an alternative, depending on your use.

openj9-openjdk also appears to be changing name to IBM Semeru. IBM messaging
is not clear on this subject, but it seems that OpenJ9 will retain its name,
but the combination of openj9-openjdk and openj9 will now be called IBM
Semeru. If this holds, dev-java/openj9-openjdk will likely be moved to
dev-java/semeru. If that happens, a package move will be used, so no end-user
action should be necessary.
